Minor issues that I might otherwise forget

* Does parsepatch handle permission changes etc. ?

* What if apply_patch yields a conflicted merge?

  (It shouldn't, but you never know.)

* git-splitpatch doesn't work on index diffs, which lack a commit
  header and a SHA and so forth.  Instead they have an index header
  that looks like

       diff --git a/a b/a
       index e8823e1..09f60e9 100644

  Probably not hard to fix.  I hope this thing doesn't turn into a
  full-blown RD parser though.

* You played a trick in write_chunk to fake up a patch header without
  actual SHAs or modes. Does it work?  Do you need real SHAs?  Does
  the fake mode work even with the file is executable, or a symlink?
  Or is the real problem the missing chunk descriptor bug? Try
  applying the split patches once that is fixed.
